This example shows how to use Spring Speak against the Amazon Lex
OrderFlowers blueprint.

Follow these steps to run the application:

 1. Start by following the instructions at 
    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/gs-bp.html, to create the 
    OrderFlowers bot. 
 2. Note the bot ID and bot alias ID.
 3. Edit src/main/resources/application.yml, replacing "<< See README >>"
    values with your values for AWS access and bot ID values.
 4. Run the application: `./mvnw spring-boot:run`
 5. Open your browser(*) to https://localhost:8080
 6. To speak to the application, click and hold the microphone button while 
    speaking a query.
    - Try "hello", "hi", "howdy" or some other greeting to get a hello 
      response.
    - Try "I would like to order some flowers" to start a flower order.
    - Try "I want to order some tulips" to start the flower order with a 
      specific flower.
 7. Alternatively, type the query into the text box and click submit.
 8. If all goes well, the query and response should be shown in the 
    transcript and the response should be spoken.


(*) Not all browsers have equal support for speech recognition and speech. 
    Speech recognition should work in Chrome, Edge, Opera, or Safari (and 
    most browsers), but at this time it does not work in Firefox.
